# Formal Verification Report for Core Contracts

## Scope
This document outlines the formal verification approaches and results for the **AlgoUSD** core contracts, specifically focusing on:
1. The `rebase` function in `AlgoUSD.sol`.
2. Median/TWAP logic and staleness checks in `OracleAggregator.sol`.

---

## Tools Used
### 1. [Solidity SMTChecker](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/smtchecker.html)
- **Capabilities**:
  - Detects assertion violations and ensures logical correctness.
  - Identifies overflows, underflows, and division-by-zero errors.
  - Verifies that certain invariants (e.g., total supply non-negative) are maintained.

- **Setup**:
  - Enabled formal verification through the Solidity compiler flag `--model-checker-engine`.

### 2. [Scribble](https://docs.scribble.tools/)
- **Capabilities**:
  - Adds inline annotations to Solidity code for runtime property checking.
  - Helps verify invariants like rebase caps, oracle price constraints, and monotonicity limits.

- **Setup**:
  - Installed Scribble package.
  - Defined properties directly within the source contracts for runtime verification.

## Verified Properties
### **AlgoUSD.sol**
#### `rebase` Function:
1. **Invariant: Total supply remains non-negative**.
   - Verified using SMTChecker.
   - Scribble annotations also validated during runtime tests.

2. **Invariant: No overflow or underflow in arithmetic operations**.
   - SMTChecker verifies no integer overflow/underflow during rebase.

3. **Invariant: Rebase respects caps set by CircuitBreaker**.
   - Scribble properties validate rebase percentage does not exceed `maxRebasePercentPerEpoch`.

4. **Property: Rebase respects monotonic limits**.
   - Scribble annotations ensure calculated supply changes are within expected limits.

#### Results:
- **Pass**: Total supply non-negative, arithmetic safety checks.
- **Pass**: Cap enforcement validated.
- **Pass**: Monotonic limits verified.

### **OracleAggregator.sol**
#### `getAggregatedPrice` Function:
1. **Invariant: Only valid (not stale) prices are used**.
   - Outdated prices exceeding `stalenessThreshold` are removed.
   - Verified with SMTChecker and Scribble annotations.

2. **Invariant: Median is calculated correctly with valid inputs**.
   - Scrutinized sorting logic to ensure accuracy.

3. **Property: Handles feed discrepancies gracefully**.
   - Adversarial tests simulate manipulated feeds.

#### Results:
- **Pass**: Staleness checks validated.
- **Pass**: Median calculations verified.
- **Pass**: No runtime failures in discrepancy handling.

---

## Summary
- Both contracts passed **SMTChecker** analysis and runtime evaluations using **Scribble**.
- All critical properties were successfully verified, including invariants related to integer safety, price aggregation, and rebasing.

Further refinement and testing can explore additional edge cases for adversarial scenarios like oracle manipulation and flash-loan mass actions.

## Next Steps
1. Generate Scribble property annotations directly within `AlgoUSD.sol` and `OracleAggregator.sol`.
2. Share verification scripts and execution results for community review and improvements.
3. Explore symbolic execution (e.g., Manticore or Mythril) for deeper adversarial testing.
